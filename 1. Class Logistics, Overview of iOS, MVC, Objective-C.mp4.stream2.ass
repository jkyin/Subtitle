Dialogue: 0,0:28:37.43,0:28:38.89,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and those might be\Nthe three tabs.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:39.29,0:28:40.82,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay, and each one is\Nits own little MVC,

Dialogue: 0,0:28:53.11,0:28:54.40,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And so it's modular in that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:54.40,0:28:58.37,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}You can also see that there's no\Ncommunication between any other,

Dialogue: 0,0:29:12.85,0:29:15.37,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}But that's the only kind of\Ncommunication you're going

Dialogue: 0,0:32:23.96,0:32:25.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And, so, I'm going to show you,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:25.84,0:32:27.66,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in today's lecture I'm just\Ngoing to show you card,

Dialogue: 0,0:32:30.16,0:32:32.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and playing card deck\Nand playing card.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:33.21,0:32:37.52,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So, every class in objective-C,\Nyou have a header file, card.h,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:37.69,0:32:40.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and you have an implementation\Nfile, card.m. Okay, this is just
Dialogue: 0,0:32:40.95,0:32:44.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}like in C++ you might have\Nthat h and dot c, or whatever,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:45.02,0:32:49.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}this is dot m, m I guess is for\Nimplementation, I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:49.52,0:32:52.93,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}But it's m [laughter], and so\Nyou have these separate things,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:53.16,0:32:57.06,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}the difference here is\Ncard.h is the public API.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:58.29,0:32:59.90,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}That's what your dot h is.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:59.93,0:33:01.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}It's your public API.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:03.17,0:33:08.93,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Card.m is your private API and\Nall your implementation, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:33:09.29,0:33:10.74,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Don't get confused about dot h
Dialogue: 0,0:33:10.74,0:33:14.72,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and dot m. All dot h is your\Npublic API, that's all it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:14.72,0:33:17.80,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}It's what methods in your\Nclass you want to make public
Dialogue: 0,0:33:17.80,0:33:20.82,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so that other people\Ncan call them, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:33:21.01,0:33:23.44,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So, let's see what\Nthe syntax looks like.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:24.04,0:33:28.13,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}In your public API, you must\Nsay who your superclass is.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:28.92,0:33:30.57,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? You are not allowed
Dialogue: 0,0:33:30.57,0:33:33.94,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to make your superclass\Nbe a secret, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:33:33.94,0:33:36.26,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}It has to be public so we have\Nto put it in the header file,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:36.61,0:33:39.12,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and you can see the syntax\Nwe use is at sign interface,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:39.34,0:33:42.46,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}the name of our class, which\Nshould always match the name
Dialogue: 0,0:33:42.46,0:33:43.34,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}of the file, by the way,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:43.34,0:33:46.34,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}card.h should always have the\Ninterface for the class card.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:47.08,0:33:49.35,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And then a colon and\Nthen your superclass.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:49.60,0:33:52.64,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Now the superclass of the\Ncard class is NSObject.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:52.73,0:33:56.47,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}NSObject is in the\Nfoundation framework
Dialogue: 0,0:33:57.14,0:34:00.47,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and it's pretty much the root\Nclass of every single class
Dialogue: 0,0:34:00.47,0:34:02.81,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in all of iOS, including\Nall the classes you write.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:03.34,0:34:05.64,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? It's this kind of basic\Nclass, we'll talk about it
Dialogue: 0,0:34:05.64,0:34:07.75,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}when we talk about\Nfoundation, but it's going
Dialogue: 0,0:34:07.75,0:34:10.44,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to be the superclass eventually\Nof every single class.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:10.60,0:34:13.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Right? Everything, eventually,\Ninherits from NSObject.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:13.58,0:34:17.55,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Now, on the implementation\Nside, it looks very similar,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:17.55,0:34:19.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}but instead of saying\Nat sign interface,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:19.09,0:34:22.24,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}you say at sign implementation\Nand the name of the class.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:22.24,0:34:25.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And here you don't specify\Nyour superclass, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:25.83,0:34:27.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Because you're only allowed\Nto specify that once,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:27.86,0:34:30.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and its public, so it\Ngoes in your header file.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:30.39,0:34:32.15,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Notice that the bottom\Nof both of these,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:32.15,0:34:33.77,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}little at sign end,\Ndo you see that?
Dialogue: 0,0:34:34.37,0:34:37.00,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay, that just means that's\Nthe end of the interface
Dialogue: 0,0:34:37.00,0:34:38.12,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}or of the implantation.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:38.75,0:34:41.52,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So all of your\Npublic API goes inside this
Dialogue: 0,0:34:41.52,0:34:43.90,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}at sign interface\Nblock, at sign interface,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:43.90,0:34:47.61,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and all of your implementation,\Nyour private implementation goes
Dialogue: 0,0:34:47.61,0:34:49.52,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in the at sign implementation\Npart.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:49.91,0:34:54.71,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Now, if you import, if you have\Nspecified your superclass here,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:54.71,0:34:55.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}you have to import it.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:56.18,0:34:57.88,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? Which is like\Npound sign, include.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.88,0:35:00.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}It's a little more powerful than\Npound sign, include, in fact,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:00.36,0:35:02.22,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}it's a lot more powerful,\Nas I'll talk
Dialogue: 0,0:35:02.22,0:35:02.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}about in a second here.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:03.23,0:35:04.56,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}>> But you must import it,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:04.56,0:35:07.23,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}otherwise the objective-C\Ncompiler won't know what
Dialogue: 0,0:35:07.23,0:35:08.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}that superclass is, so\Nyou have to, obviously,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:08.95,0:35:10.12,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}import your superclass.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:10.12,0:35:11.58,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}However, we don't usually,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:11.78,0:35:14.53,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}when our superclass is\Nsomething that's in iOS,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:14.92,0:35:17.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}we don't usually import just\Nthat classes header file,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:17.92,0:35:19.21,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}which in this case\Nis foundation,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:19.58,0:35:22.03,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}we actually import\Nthe entire framework.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:23.13,0:35:26.20,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? Now you might say,\Noh, that's inefficient.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:26.80,0:35:28.77,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}[Pause] A huge framework,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:28.77,0:35:32.57,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}but of course this is all\Nprecompiled and optimized.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:32.78,0:35:36.66,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And, in fact, in iOS7, the\Nsyntax for this is really to say
Dialogue: 0,0:35:36.66,0:35:38.81,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}at sign import foundation.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:39.21,0:35:42.14,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}That means I'm going to\Nuse all the public classes
Dialogue: 0,0:35:42.47,0:35:43.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in the foundation framework.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:44.15,0:35:48.56,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}iOS7 still supports the old\Nimportant foundation slash
Dialogue: 0,0:35:48.56,0:35:51.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}foundation.h so you can\Nuse that if you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:51.86,0:35:53.53,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Now on our implementation file,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:53.80,0:35:56.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}we have to import our\Nheader file, obviously.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:57.24,0:35:59.22,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? Because our\Nimplementation file needs
Dialogue: 0,0:35:59.22,0:36:03.47,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to know what we're committing to\Npublicly, in terms of our API,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:03.82,0:36:04.88,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so we have to import that.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:05.14,0:36:07.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Makes perfect sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:07.40,0:36:11.80,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}We can also have private\Ndeclarations, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:11.80,0:36:15.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Declarations of properties and\Nmethods that are private inside
Dialogue: 0,0:36:16.24,0:36:18.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}of our implementation file\Nby putting this little
Dialogue: 0,0:36:18.98,0:36:20.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}at sign interface,\Nname of our class,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:21.06,0:36:22.66,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}open parentheses,\Nclosed parentheses.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:23.57,0:36:24.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? And then at sign end.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:24.95,0:36:26.25,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So we can have a\Nlittle space here
Dialogue: 0,0:36:26.25,0:36:27.88,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}where we can little\Nprivate declarations.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:27.88,0:36:30.48,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Now, objective-C\Ndoes not require you
Dialogue: 0,0:36:30.52,0:36:33.63,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to declare something\Nbefore you use it in a file,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:34.00,0:36:34.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}you know what I mean by that?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:34.73,0:36:37.25,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And there's a lot,\Na lot of languages,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:37.47,0:36:40.34,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}you have to declare a method\Nbefore you can call it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.62,0:36:42.27,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}But you can do it out\Nof order in objective-C,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:42.27,0:36:44.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}you can implement a\Nmethod here that calls,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:44.99,0:36:47.43,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}you can implement\Nmethod A, calls method B,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:47.43,0:36:50.15,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and then method B is implemented\Ndown here later in the file.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:50.46,0:36:52.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So you don't have\Nto declare method B first,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:52.82,0:36:56.67,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}then implement method A, and\Nthen implement method B. So,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:56.92,0:37:00.00,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}this little private at sign\Ninterface we're mostly going
Dialogue: 0,0:37:00.00,0:37:01.08,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to use for properties.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:01.45,0:37:04.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? Because when we declare\Na property, as you'll see,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:04.84,0:37:06.64,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}that setter and getter\Nget written for us.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:06.89,0:37:09.93,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So let's see what that looks\Nlike to declare a property.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:10.04,0:37:11.90,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So here's a simple property.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:12.13,0:37:13.28,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}It's called contents.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:13.45,0:37:15.18,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So this is the content\Nof the card.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:15.18,0:37:16.59,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}This is what's on the card.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:17.06,0:37:18.87,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So this might be ace of clubs.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:19.52,0:37:23.20,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? And because this\Nis your first day,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:23.33,0:37:26.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}we're going to make the contents\Nbe very simple, just a string.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:26.45,0:37:29.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So these cards, they can\Nbe like a flashcard, maybe,

Dialogue: 0,0:37:36.41,0:37:40.96,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}where this content is the name\Nof some image and it's up to UI

Dialogue: 0,0:37:43.26,0:37:45.43,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Or in the case of\Nour playing cards,

Dialogue: 0,0:37:47.90,0:37:49.38,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and then the character clubs,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:49.43,0:37:52.83,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}because there's Unicode\Ncharacter clubs, so the A clubs,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:52.83,0:37:53.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}that would be the content.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:53.65,0:37:56.06,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So this is the content of\Nthe card, what's on the card.

Dialogue: 0,0:43:48.69,0:43:50.07,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}of the instance variable
Dialogue: 0,0:43:50.31,0:43:53.26,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in which the property\Ncontents is going to be stored.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:53.95,0:43:56.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Now we could say at sign\Nsynthesize contents equals foo
Dialogue: 0,0:43:57.17,0:43:59.11,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}[phonetic], and then contents\Nproperty would be stored
Dialogue: 0,0:43:59.11,0:44:00.33,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in an instance variable\Ncalled foo.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:00.33,0:44:01.92,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}But that would be\Nvery confusing,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:02.02,0:44:04.97,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so we always use underbar\Nname of the property.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:05.17,0:44:07.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? And so that's part one,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:07.79,0:44:09.76,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}just basically allocating\Nan instance variable
Dialogue: 0,0:44:09.76,0:44:11.92,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to store this contents property.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:12.30,0:44:15.74,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Then there's the getter,\Nthat's NSString contents,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:15.74,0:44:18.85,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}return contents, so\Nthe dash, parentheses,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:18.91,0:44:23.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}NSString contents is a method\Ndeclaration in objective-C,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:23.77,0:44:25.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}the dash means this is a method,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:25.49,0:44:27.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}parentheses NSString star\Nmeans this is a method
Dialogue: 0,0:44:27.95,0:44:29.74,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}that returns a pointer\Nto a string,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:30.85,0:44:32.87,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and contents is the\Nname of the method.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:33.60,0:44:35.70,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So the name of the method\Nof the getter is the same
Dialogue: 0,0:44:35.70,0:44:36.75,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}as the name of the property.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:37.41,0:44:39.87,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Then, the implementation\Nis just return

Dialogue: 0,0:44:43.55,0:44:47.38,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? And similarly, the\Nnext method is a method
Dialogue: 0,0:44:47.53,0:44:48.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in objective-C for setting it.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:49.08,0:44:51.06,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And, again, dash\N[inaudible] method.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:51.55,0:44:54.69,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Parentheses void means this\Nmethod does not return anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:55.35,0:44:57.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? That's what\Nparentheses void means.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:57.56,0:44:59.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Then set contents\Ncolon, that's the name
Dialogue: 0,0:44:59.78,0:45:01.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}of this method, set\Ncontents colon.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:03.05,0:45:06.87,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Parentheses NSString star is\Nthe argument to this method.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:07.26,0:45:10.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Contents is just the name of\Nthe argument, the local name
Dialogue: 0,0:45:10.42,0:45:13.52,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}of the variable in the\Nlocal contents, context,
Dialogue: 0,0:45:14.01,0:45:17.04,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and the implementation is\Njust underbar contents,
Dialogue: 0,0:45:17.04,0:45:19.30,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}our instance variable\Nequals that argument.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:20.29,0:45:22.46,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So, before I move on,
Dialogue: 0,0:45:22.46,0:45:27.57,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}does everyone understand how\Nthese two methods are allowing

Dialogue: 0,0:45:35.83,0:45:36.83,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Question? [Inaudible\Nbackground question] Okay,
Dialogue: 0,0:45:38.60,0:45:43.15,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so the synthesize line, again,\Nis just specifying the name
Dialogue: 0,0:45:43.15,0:45:45.10,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}of the instance variable\Nthat we're going to use
Dialogue: 0,0:45:45.10,0:45:47.48,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to store this stuff\Nin, underbar contents.

Dialogue: 0,0:46:03.63,0:46:04.85,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}we'll use the instance variable
Dialogue: 0,0:46:04.85,0:46:06.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}with the name, underbar\Ncontents.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:06.89,0:46:08.24,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So that's what the\Nsynthesize is doing.

Dialogue: 0,0:46:15.32,0:46:17.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in your getter and setter, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:46:17.42,0:46:18.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Everyone understand this?
Dialogue: 0,0:46:19.25,0:46:20.10,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,0:46:21.08,0:46:23.74,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay, now, the thing about\Nit is, when you type the

Dialogue: 0,0:46:32.17,0:46:33.97,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So it's there, but\Nyou don't see it.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:34.54,0:46:38.41,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay, objective-C is, made it\Nfor you, but it doesn't show it
Dialogue: 0,0:46:38.41,0:46:41.07,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to you, but it's there,\Nokay, that setter method
Dialogue: 0,0:46:41.07,0:46:43.63,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and that setter-getter\Nmethod are there.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:44.10,0:46:44.97,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? They exist.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:45.09,0:46:47.88,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And not only that, they're\Npublic, because you put
Dialogue: 0,0:46:47.88,0:46:50.13,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}that at sign property\Ndeclaration in your header file.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:51.50,0:46:52.19,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Everyone got that?
Dialogue: 0,0:46:53.25,0:46:55.22,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So let's look at another\Ncouple properties just
Dialogue: 0,0:46:55.22,0:46:56.45,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to see the syntax a little more.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:56.67,0:46:59.02,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So here's two properties\Nthat are bullions [phonetic].
Dialogue: 0,0:46:59.33,0:47:02.38,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? There's no\Nbullion primitive in C,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:02.57,0:47:06.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so objective-C has to find,\Ntypedef all caps BULL,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:06.85,0:47:09.66,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}probably a short or\Nsomething or an int or a char,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:09.66,0:47:12.56,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}I don't know what, but you can\Nthink of it as a primitive type,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:12.56,0:47:15.08,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}it's a boolean, it's\Nvalue can either be yes,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:15.24,0:47:17.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}which is some non-zero\Nvalue, or no which is zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:18.80,0:47:21.48,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And these properties don't\Nneed the strong or weak.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:21.48,0:47:23.38,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Do you understand why that is?
Dialogue: 0,0:47:24.02,0:47:25.36,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Because they're primitive types,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:25.50,0:47:27.79,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}they're not stored\Nin the heap, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:47:27.86,0:47:30.89,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}They're just a int or a float,\Nso there's no memory to manage
Dialogue: 0,0:47:30.89,0:47:32.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so you don't need to know\Nabout strong and weak pointers,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:32.86,0:47:34.02,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}there's no pointers\Ninvolved here,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:34.02,0:47:35.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}this is just a BULL, a bullion.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:35.92,0:47:38.69,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So there's no strong or weak,\Nbut we still have the nonatomic,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:38.95,0:47:41.39,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}because we still want the setter\Nand the getter to be simple,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:41.39,0:47:42.99,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}not having any locking code\Nor any of that business.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:42.99,0:47:44.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So we're always going\Nto have nonatomic
Dialogue: 0,0:47:44.90,0:47:46.51,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}on every property in this class.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:46.90,0:47:48.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}We will not have a single\Nproperty in this entire class

Dialogue: 0,0:47:49.92,0:47:51.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So just put it in there, I\Nwish it were the default.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:51.68,0:47:54.97,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So that's what\Nwe're going to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:54.97,0:47:57.58,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}You can see we've\Nsynthesized them both
Dialogue: 0,0:47:57.58,0:47:59.61,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and we've got the setter and\Nthe getter for them both,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:59.61,0:48:02.38,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and this is all being done\Nfor us by objective-C.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:02.65,0:48:06.19,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Now, one thing that's kind of\Ncool is we may not like the name
Dialogue: 0,0:48:06.19,0:48:08.70,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}of this getter, because we\Nwant our code to read something
Dialogue: 0,0:48:08.70,0:48:12.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}like if card is chosen,\Nthen do something.

Dialogue: 0,0:48:14.93,0:48:17.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So we really want the\Ngetter called is chosen,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:17.31,0:48:18.17,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}not just chosen.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:18.48,0:48:22.03,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}You know, if card chosen, not\Nas nice as if card is chosen.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:22.06,0:48:24.79,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So it's actually possible\Nto rename the getter
Dialogue: 0,0:48:25.22,0:48:28.00,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}by saying getter equals\Nthe new name you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:29.08,0:48:31.57,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? And that's essentially\Nrenamed it, same thing,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:31.57,0:48:32.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}we'll do the same\Nthing with this one.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:32.90,0:48:34.01,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Getter equals is matched,

Dialogue: 0,0:48:46.60,0:48:50.35,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? And again, objective-C\Nis writing all this code on,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:50.35,0:48:52.83,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}in the implementation,\Nbut you don't see it.

Dialogue: 0,0:49:27.35,0:49:30.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So that contents property,\Nwhen we create a new card,

Dialogue: 0,0:50:05.23,0:50:07.02,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}our own public method,\Nso I'm going
Dialogue: 0,0:50:07.02,0:50:08.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to define this method\Ncalled match.

Dialogue: 0,0:50:18.26,0:50:19.37,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So I need a match method.

Dialogue: 0,0:50:23.12,0:50:26.20,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So, I'm trying\Nto make this simple,
Dialogue: 0,0:50:26.20,0:50:27.63,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so I've made a simple\Nmatch method

Dialogue: 0,0:50:42.44,0:50:45.11,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So like a really good\Nmatch might be a thousand,
Dialogue: 0,0:50:45.50,0:50:47.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}but a not so good match\Nmight only be a hundred, and,

Dialogue: 0,0:50:56.43,0:50:58.47,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And we're going to find out\Nhow good a match they are

Dialogue: 0,0:51:09.68,0:51:11.09,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}than it is for matching\Nthe suit.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:11.56,0:51:14.55,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? But that's up\Nto subclasses of cards
Dialogue: 0,0:51:14.55,0:51:16.62,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to determine what the\Npoint system is, okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:51:16.62,0:51:20.76,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So, for our implementation\Nof match, okay,
Dialogue: 0,0:51:20.76,0:51:22.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}we're going to do a really\Nsimple implementation, so,

Dialogue: 0,0:51:25.41,0:51:28.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay, so I just made this local\Nvariable int score equals zero,
Dialogue: 0,0:51:28.42,0:51:30.57,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}you can see that you\Ncan assign a variable,

Dialogue: 0,0:51:33.11,0:51:35.04,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so I don't even really\Nneed that equals zero,
Dialogue: 0,0:51:35.33,0:51:37.10,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}but I'm a big believer\Nin putting that in

Dialogue: 0,0:51:39.88,0:51:42.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and in this case I intend the\Nscore to be actually zero.

Dialogue: 0,0:55:04.51,0:55:07.73,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? So now I'm matching this\Ncard that I'm sending this to,

Dialogue: 0,0:55:09.98,0:55:13.90,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So now I'm going to need some\Nnew algorithm to match, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:55:14.37,0:55:16.37,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So, again, a playing card match,
Dialogue: 0,0:55:16.60,0:55:18.42,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}if let's say you had\Nmatching three cards,

Dialogue: 0,0:55:32.07,0:55:34.79,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So, here I'm changing\Nmatch to take an array

Dialogue: 0,0:55:37.33,0:55:39.91,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}And how would I change\Nmy implementation

Dialogue: 0,0:55:41.04,0:55:44.60,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Well, I'm just going to put\Na four-loop around my if

Dialogue: 0,0:55:46.96,0:55:49.83,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}and so this implementation,\Nhopefully those of you
Dialogue: 0,0:55:49.83,0:55:51.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}who are quick thinkers, you\Ncan know what this does,

Dialogue: 0,0:55:53.87,0:55:56.89,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}if the card that's\Nreceiving this matches any

Dialogue: 0,0:56:01.04,0:56:03.34,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Okay? Now you can imagine a\Nlot better algorithms here.
Dialogue: 0,0:56:03.53,0:56:06.29,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Maybe you get one point\Nfor every card you match

Dialogue: 0,0:56:18.97,0:56:21.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}But mostly what I wanted to\Nshow you here is what it looks
Dialogue: 0,0:56:21.78,0:56:23.13,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}like to have an array
Dialogue: 0,0:56:23.35,0:56:24.98,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}as the argument instead\Nof a single card.
Dialogue: 0,0:56:25.27,0:56:27.68,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So that you understand that\Nthe argument, what the argument
Dialogue: 0,0:56:27.68,0:56:29.39,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}to the method is and also
Dialogue: 0,0:56:29.39,0:56:31.65,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so I can show you\Nthe four-loop there.

Dialogue: 0,0:56:59.15,0:56:59.95,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}That's a great question.
Dialogue: 0,0:57:00.19,0:57:02.78,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}So the question is if I\Njust have that four-line,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:02.78,0:57:04.86,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}but I said four card card,

Dialogue: 0,0:57:11.05,0:57:13.84,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Why? Because all objects\Nare always pointed

Dialogue: 0,0:57:17.50,0:57:21.99,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}Alright? You can't have a card\Nnot being a pointer to it,
Dialogue: 0,0:57:21.99,0:57:25.23,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}so the, you know, objective-C\Nwould give you a syntax error
Dialogue: 0,0:57:25.23,0:57:27.37,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}there, it's impossible\Nto not have that star.

Dialogue: 0,0:57:37.76,0:57:40.69,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}can I use the square\Nbrackets to call the setter

Dialogue: 0,0:57:57.49,0:57:59.96,冬青黑体简体中文,NTP,0,0,0,,{\fs14}The question is should you\Nuse square brackets for setter
